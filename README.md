This repository contains the source code for the supercharged, remastered 2021 [Vue.js 3 Masterclass](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class) course.

We’ve taken all the feedback we got from The Vue.js 2 Masterclass, and supercharged The Vue.js Masterclass with all the new goodies from Vue.js 3 and the ecosystem.

This is our signature course. It is probably the most thorough Vue.js course available online.

The Vue.js Masterclass is so comprehensive that we **can not cover everything on this page**. Thus we’ve created a [separate page](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class) where you can learn more about it.

In our Masterclass you'll learn Vue.js by building a real-world application. Together we’ll create a complete forum from scratch using exciting technologies that synergize with Vue.

The goal of the Masterclass is to teach you Vue.js along with Best Practices, Modern Javascript, and other exciting technologies, by building a Real World application - a forum.

### We cover the fundamentals, like:

- Vue cli, router, and State management with Vuex
- Modern Javascript (ES6/7/8)
- User permissions & Route Guards
- Third party authentication
- Google Cloud Firestore
- Automatic code review with ESLint
- Consuming REST API
- Application architecture and best practices

### We also dive into harder topics, like:

- Higher Order Functions
- Creating Vue Plugins
- Code Splitting
- Support for older Browsers
- Webpack configuration
- SEO and pre-rendering
- Deployments


By completing the Vue.js Masterclass, you will be able to land any Vue related job or optimize/improve your own projects!

## Looking for Composition API, Pinia, TypeScript, etc?
Since this video course was created, a lot has changed in the Vue.js ecosystem. [We have a brand new Master Class](https://vue.school/masterclass) geared towards addressing and teaching these updated technologies (WIP as of Q1 2024). We've had an amazing community member complete this course however, with these latest technologies. You can [see his source code in this github repo](https://github.com/JeremieLitzler/vueschool-course/tree/forum-vite). Thanks Jérémie!
